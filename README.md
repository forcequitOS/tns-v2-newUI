# TotallyNotSpyware v2 Redesigned
<img src="https://github.com/forcequitOS/tns-v2-newUI/blob/main/showcase.jpeg?raw=true" width="25%">

## This is an (unofficial) complete redesign of TNS v2 for iOS 12.
**You can try it now at https://tns12.forcequit.cc!**

This modification most importantly adds support for **adding the page to your Home Screen as a web clip**, with an icon and even **offline support**!

This is an unofficial modification, so, do be careful, but I can say pretty confidently that this doesn't install malware or anything, and you can independently verify the source if you so desire.

## Random troubleshooting note

If the background gradient animates, the re-jailbreak's not going to work. Reload the page / reboot your device and try again.

## Full list of changes:

- Offline support, as long as you add it to Home Screen and run it once, you should be fine.
- Beloved fancy background gradient
- Credits as a collapsible list
- Graying out the rejailbreak button for unsupported devices (I just check user agents)
- No more found JOP chain alert (Worse for debugging I assume, but better to just rejailbreak your device.)
- (Obviously) Can add to Home Screen, and run full screen, not in Safari, with an app icon and a name. Revolutionary.
- Looks pretty now. Uses system font, etc. etc.
- Actual title and favicon, alongside some Open Graph metadata

## But as always, there is one more thing.

If someone can figure out how I could stop the page from scrolling and bouncing around all over the place, I'd be eternally grateful. But if not I don't really care either. Other than that, I think this is largely "pretty great", not much more to improve.

<sub>I've probably used the actual absolute messiest CSS I've ever written in my life to make this, oh well.</sub>
