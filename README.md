# TotallyNotSpyware v2 Redesigned

## This is an (unofficial) complete redesign of TNS v2 for iOS 12.
**Want to try it?** This project is now live at https://tns12.pages.dev.

This modification most importantly adds support for **adding the page to your Home Screen as a web clip**, with an icon and everything. Unfortunately, I have not quite cracked the code to saving everything to disk so that it can run offline. I don't even know if iOS 12 supports doing that. If you know how to do it, let me know and I'll add it.

This is an unofficial modification, so, do be careful, but I can say pretty confidently that this doesn't install malware or anything, and you can independently verify the source if you so desire.

## Random troubleshooting note

If the background gradient animates, the re-jailbreak's not going to work. Reload the page / reboot your device and try again.

**Full list of changes:**

- Beloved fancy background gradient
- Credits as a collapsible list
- Graying out the rejailbreak button for unsupported devices (I just check user agents)
- No more found JOP chain alert (Worse for debugging I assume, but better to just rejailbreak your device.)
- (Obviously) Can add to Home Screen, and run full screen, not in Safari, with an app icon and a name. Revolutionary.
- Looks pretty now. Uses system font, etc. etc.

<sub>I've probably used the actual absolute messiest CSS I've ever written in my life to make this, oh well.</sub>
